      h3 Jesus Christ
      p How often I am arrogant and impressed with myself. And then I am gently reminded:
        pre
          | For who sees anything different in you? What do you have 
          | that you did not receive? If then you received it, 
          | why do you boast as if you did not receive it?
          | - (1 Corinthians 4:7 ESV)
        | I am in need of a rescuer and that rescuer is Jesus Christ.
        pre
          | And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name 
          | under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
          | - (Acts 4:12 ESV)

      p Mike is my technical partner in crime.  He did most of the development for the SproutCore Statecharts 
        | of which Stativus is derived.  He has been a constant friend and pushes me to make better and bolder 
        | choices.

      p Erich was the first to introduce me to Statecharts and I will forever be grateful.  Erich has
